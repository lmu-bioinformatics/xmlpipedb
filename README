match: A grep-like tool that takes unique matches into account
==============================================================

match is a utility that was developed specifically to assist in vetting
and debugging GenMAPP Builder-exported Gene Database files for GenMAPP.
When inspecting an exported Gene Database, specific ID counts are needed,
with IDs tracked from the original XML file to the final .gdb file.  To do
this count properly, the equivalent of a "select distinct" must be performed:
matching patterns should be found in the XML file, with duplicate matches
taken into consideration as an individual ID.

The match utility works similarly to grep: it takes a regular expression and
an input text stream, typically redirected from a file.  match then searches
the text stream for matching substrings.  If the substring has been encountered
before, then the tally for that substring is increased.  New substrings add to
the total number of *unique* substrings encountered.  The final result is a
list of unique matches, including how many times each matched substring was
found and the total number of unique matches.


Requirements
------------

- Java Runtime Environment, version 1.5 or later.  Make sure that "java"
  can be invoked directly on the command line.


Instructions
------------

- Unzip the archive; take note of where you extracted the files.  For the
  rest of this README, let <path> represent this location.

- The match utility is a command-line program.  Using <path> as defined above,
  then type the following to run match on some <textfile>:

    java -jar <path>/xmlpipedb-match-1.1.jar <regular expression> < <textfile>

  (in Windows, replace the forward slash [/] after <path> with a backslash
   character [\])

- Running the match utility with no arguments produces a quick reminder of the
  arguments that it needs.
   
- The match utility takes text from standard input, so all other mechanisms
  for standard input will also apply, if you are familiar with them.

- The match utility can report results based on regular expression groups.
  To do this, add the desired group number after the regular expression.
