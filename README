What is XSD2DB?
XSD2DB is a program for converting an XML Schema Definition (XSD) or Document Type Definition (DTD) into a database schema (SQL) file and a set of Hibernate mapping files and Java classes. The output includes a build.xml file, which will run under ANT to build a .jar file for you. Jar file allows you to access your database using Hibernate (http://www.hibernate.org/).

Other applications you may need: UniprotDb, GoDb, XMLPipeDb Utilities, GenMAPP Builder.

Features:
- takes XSD or DTD files
- outputs SQL schema file
- outputs all Hibernate .java files
- outputs all Hibernate mapping (.hbm) files
- outputs customized build.xml to compile all classes and generate a jar file 

Requirements:
ANT (http://ant.apache.org/) version 1.6.5 or better is required to build a .jar file, but the program will run without this.

Installation:
-- clean install --
Simply extract all files into a folder (e.g. xsd2db).
WARNING: DO NOT use folders with special charactes in them, e.g. "!temp" will not work.

-- upgrade --
Delete all previous file / versions, then follow the instructions for a "clean install".


Running XSD2DB:
Windows:
xsd2db [--outputDirectory=dirname] [--bindings=filename] [[-updateXSD] --xsdURL=url] [-help]

Unix/Linux/OSX:
./xsd2db [--outputDirectory=dirname] [--bindings=filename] [[-updateXSD] --xsdURL=url] [-help]


--outputDirectory=dirname 
The directory when generating the source code and file; defaults to dg-gen

--bindings=filename       
The binding file used when generation the data base source code and files for the time. Defaults to standard binding file supplied by XSD-To-DB

--xsdURL=url              
The URL of the XSD to convert. This must be a URL on the web. A file URL will not work.

--dtdSchema               
Enables support for DTDs

-updateXSD                
Replaces the XSD being used with the new version

Documentation & Support:
The first-level of support is YOU. Read the User's and Developers Manual and this readme. After that, if something doesn't work or you just can't figure it out, second-level support can be obtained by going to http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmlpipedb/ and clicking on "support requests". We will try to help you as soon as possible. In the meantime (or even before submitting your request) check to see if someone else had the same problem -- maybe all the answers you need are already there!
