<h2>XMLPipeDB: A Reusable, Open Source Tool Chain for Building
Relational Databases from XML Sources</h2>
-->

<p>XMLPipeDB is an open source suite of Java-based tools for
automatically building relational databases from an XML schema (XSD).
XMLPipeDB provides functionality for managing, querying, importing, and
exporting information to and from XML data with minimum manual
processing of the data. While its applicability is fairly general, the
original motivation for XMLPipeDB was to create a solution for the
management of biological data from different sources that are used to
create Gene Databases for <a class="external" href="http://www.GenMAPP.org"

Profiler)</a>, software for viewing and analyzing DNA microarray and other
genomic and proteomic data on biological pathways.</p>
