\abstract{
We set out to create a method of importing data from large genetic databases into the format used by \genmapp. We limited the scope of our work to Uniprot and GO databases and used PostgreSQL as our intermediate database. We were determined to use as many existing, open source tools as possible to facilitate this. We used \hyperjaxb2 to facilitate generation of database schemas, \hibernate~mapping files and target-specific \hibernate~class files.  \hibernate~ provides the object to relational mapping. We have built a chain of tools to go from an XML Schema Definition (XSD) to a \genmapp~database file. We also succeeded in building many reusable components that are neither specific to- nor tied solely to- bioinformatics, Uniprot, GO or \genmapp. \textit{xsd2db} allow users to convert any XSD to an SQL database schema and supporting \hibernate~files. \textit{xmlpipedbutils} allows users to configure a system to use \hibernate~for database access, preview XML data, import XML data, and run queries on data in the database. Three more tools, uniprotdb, godb and genmapp builder, were required to meet our end goal - generation of a \genmapp~database file. This tool set is unique in that there is no open source tool set that uses \hyperjaxb2~and \hibernate~to accomplish such tasks.

\section{Conclusion}
Despite the pitfalls encountered, incredibly tight timeframes and demands of assimilating an entirely new domain of knowledge, the XMLPipeDB team has produced an initial release of outstanding quality and utility. In each area, we have identified additional work to be done, whether to add polish, tweak bugs or add new functionality. The real test will come, however, when the biological community begins to use the tool chain and reap the rewards of our effort. Our since hope is that it will meet their needs and allow them to make more interesting discoveries about the building blocks of life. Of course, there will be issues and we will rise to meet the challenge. There will also be additional databases to support and format changes. These, too, we will strive to accomodate. Of course, one of the great advantages of this tool chain being open source is that it is not left only to us to do this work, but to anyone with the vision and the will to make it happen.
