\section{Background and Motivation}
With the introduction of DNA micro arrays, there is a need for tools
to aid in the processing of large amounts of Bioinformatic 
data.  GenMAPP~\cite{genmapp} is a tool used widely in the
Bioinformatics community to visualize the changes in known 
pathways using data collected from DNA micro arrays. In 
addition, GenMAPP is available to download for free. However,
GenMAPP has one severe limitation.  It can only be used on 
an organism for which a GenMAPP gene database already exists.  
The current process for GenMAPP gene database creation is to 
use Ensembl~\cite{ensembl} as the base database.  
The problem with this approach is that the Ensembl database 
only contains mammals and thus it is very limited.  
By creating a process through which GenMAPP databases for 
any organism may be created, we have pushed the door to 
the world of micro array analysis wide open.
