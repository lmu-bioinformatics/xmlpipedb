\section{Overall Design and Approach}
To understand the overall design of XMLPipeDB we must first state our initial 
goal:  To create a reusable tool set that given genomic sequencing data for 
an organism in xml and a schema for that xml document could out put a working 
GenMAPP gene database for that organism.  Given the many different source 
organizations, and consequently different schemas,  for this xml data we 
wanted to be able to automate this process as much as possible.  In the 
initial research phase of the project we managed to find that quite a fair 
amount of work had already been done by the open source community to reach 
our final goal.  The JAXB reference implementation contained an xml schema 
compiler to automatically create JAXB objects given an xml schema.   
Hyberjaxb could then be used to annotate these objects and automatically 
generate Hibernate mappings for them.  We could then use hibernate and 
the generated hibernate mappings to place these objects into a relational  
database.  Finally we could export the needed fields from our relational 
database to create our GenMAPP gene database. 

Initially the project seemed simple and we attempted to design it as a 
single unit, but after some experimentation we noted that some additional 
post processing was necessary and it made more since to break the project 
up into three different stages.  The first stage which we called xsd2db, 
described more thoroughly in \ref{xsd2db}, would be a general purpose JAXB 
object and hibernate mapping generator that would take an xml schema file 
as input.

The second part of the project was born from xsd2db.  uniprotdb, 
which is described more thoroughly in \ref{uniprotdb},
was created 
using the UniProt xml schema obtained from the UniProt website \cite{uniprotWeb}
and the xsd2db tool.  
uniprotdb houses a library of JAXB objects as well as hibernate 
mappings \cite{hyperjaxb}
that allow UniProt XML files to be transferred into a relational database.  
gmbuilder, which is detailed further in \ref{gmbuilder}, uses the uniprotdb
library to create a Microsoft Access database file that can be used by 
the GenMAPP application \cite{genmapp:ng}.
