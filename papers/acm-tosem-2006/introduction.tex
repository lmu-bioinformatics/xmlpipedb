\section{Introduction}
  The approach we propose to automaticcly migrate existing databases to a relational database and then use genmap builder to export a GenMapp gene database allows us to use virtually any existing bioinformatics database that provides exports of there database in xml.  This allows us to expand GenMapp to analyse plant and bacteria organisms.
