\section{Introduction}
  The approach we propose to automatically migrate existing databases to a relational database and then use GenMap
  \par
 	In this process we designed a set of tools to: 
 \begin{itemize}
	\item {Configure the database to import data and run queries via the configuration interface}
	\item {Import XML data into a database using the import interface}
	\item {Query the and view data with the query interface}
\end{itemize}
	This bundled functionality is separate from any particular data or database. To do this, we used a tool set called HyperJaxB. These tools allows to take XML schemas to create SQL databases, and their corresponding XML files and import them into the SQL database.
