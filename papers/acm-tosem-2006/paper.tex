\abstract{
The abstract should be 150 to 200 words long and should consist of short, direct, and complete sentences. It should state the objectives of the work, summarize the results, and give the principal conclusions and recommendations. It should indicate clearly whether the focus is on theoretical developments or on practical questions and whether subject or method is emphasized. The title need not be repeated. Work planned but not done should not be described in the abstract.

\section{Conclusion}
Despite the pitfalls encountered, incredibly tight timeframes and demands of assimilating an entirely new domain of knowledge, the XmlPipeDb team has produced an initial release of outstanding quality and utility. In each area, we have identified additional work to be done, whether to add polish, tweak bugs or add new functionality. The real test will come, however, when the biological community begins to use the tool chain and reap the rewards of our effort. Our since hope is that it will meet their needs and allow them to make more interesting discoveries about the building blocks of life. Of course, there will be issues and we will rise to meet the challenge. There will also be additional databases to support and format changes. These, too, we will strive to accomodate. Of course, one of the great advantages of this tool chain being open source is that it is not left only to us to do this work, but to anyone with the vision and the will to make it happen.
