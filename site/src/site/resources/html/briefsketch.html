<p>XMLPipeDB was created by the Bioinformatics Group at Loyola
Marymount University, a collaborative research group founded by <a
    href="http://myweb.lmu.edu/kdahlqui">Dr. Kam D. Dahlquist</a> (<a
    href="http://www.lmu.edu/PageFactory.aspx?PageID=21527">Department
of Biology</a>) and <a href="http://myweb.lmu.edu/dondi">Dr. John David
N. Dionisio</a> (Department of <a
    href="http://www.lmu.edu/PageFactory.aspx?PageID=21585">Electrical
Engineering</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.lmu.edu">Computer Science</a>).
XMLPipeDB development began in Spring 2006 as a group project in a
special studies course in <a
    href="http://myweb.lmu.edu/dondi/spring2006/cmsi698">Bioinformatics
(CMSI 698/BIOL 498)</a> team-taught by Drs. Dahlquist and Dionisio.
Development continued in a second special studies course, <a
    href="http://myweb.lmu.edu/dondi/summer2006-1/cmsi698">Open
Source Software Development Workshop (CMSI 698/598)</a> and has transitioned
into an undergraduate <a
    href="http://myweb.lmu.edu/dondi/fall2008/cmsi398">Biological
Databases (CMSI 398)</a> course.  XMLPipeDB also follows the philosophy of
Dr. Dionisio&rsquo;s <a href="http://recourse.cs.lmu.edu">Recourse</a>
project, which seeks to introduce an open source culture into the
computer science curriculum.</p>
