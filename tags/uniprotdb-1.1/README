The build file compiles the src code and creates a dist directory 
which contains the class files and hibernate mapping files as a jar, 
this README file and the schema.sql file ready for use with 
Postgresql.  In addition, the build file also has the ability to zip 
the dist directory for release.  The tools directory is a project in 
itself.  It contains a Postprocessor that is to be used when a new 
set of source files and hibernate mapping files is created.  It 
contains its own README file for more information.
