\subsection{Performing Common Operations with \emph{xmlpipedbutils}}
From the outset of the project, it was clear that some common functions would be needed. These functions were grouped together as xmlpipedbutils (XPD Utils). XPD Utils contains tools to 
\begin{itemize}
	\item {Configure the database to import data and run queries via the configuration interface}
	\item {Import XML data into a database using the import interface}
	\item {Query the and view data with the query interface}
\end{itemize}
\par
These tools not only provide behind-the-scenes work that is needed to perform these tasks, but also include GUIs. Essentially, each one is a self-contained, plugable component that performs its intended function. They are delivered bundeled together in one jar file, but they have not inherent interdependencies. 	The basic design of the utilities is a user interface with a back end engine. The engines perform the meaningful work and are designed to work with or with out the user interface. The next three sections will examine each component individually in terms of the reason it is needed, how it is designed, a frank evaluation of its capabilities and a look at what might still be done to enhance or expand on it.
