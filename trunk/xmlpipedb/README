Here are the targets of the build process.  

	* init - initializes before the build 
	* clean - cleans before the build; deletes classes, generated.sources, 
	hibernate/mapping and database directories).
    * generate.sources - invokes XJC and HyperJAXB to generate annotated sources 
    in the generated.sources directory
    * compile - compiles generated and static (those from the src directory) 
    sources into the classes directory
    * jar - packs the compiled classes and places the generated jar file into 
    the dist directory;
    * generate.hibernate.mapping - generates Hibernate mapping in the 
    hibernate/mapping directory
    * export.database.schema - exports database schema into the DDL file 
	database/schema.sql and also into the database specified in the 
	hibernate/hibernate.properties file;
    * all - full build process
