This module held prototype and experimental code for the XMLPipeDB project.

It has since been superceded by the xsd2db and xmlpipedbutils modules.

The uniprotdb and godb modules represent databases that were bootstrapped
by xsd2db.

The gmbuilder module is an application built on these databases and tools.
