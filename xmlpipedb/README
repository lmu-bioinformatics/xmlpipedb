README

Here are the targets of the build process.  

	* init - initializes before the build 
	* clean - cleans before the build; deletes classes, generated.sources, 
	hibernate/mapping and database directories).
    * generate.sources - invokes XJC and HyperJAXB to generate annotated sources 
    in the generated.sources directory
    * compile - compiles generated and static (those from the src directory) 
    sources into the classes directory
    * jar - packs the compiled classes and places the generated jar file into 
    the dist directory;
    * generate.hibernate.mapping - generates Hibernate mapping in the 
    hibernate/mapping directory
    * export.database.schema - exports database schema into the DDL file 
	database/schema.sql and also into the database specified in the 
	hibernate/hibernate.properties file;
    * all - full build process 
    
Note: On Windows machines, it has been seen that an error may occur involving javac
not being in the class path when performing the Ant build in the Eclipse 
environment.  To resolve this issue, do the following:
	* Go to Windows->Preferences->Ant->Runtime.  
	* Add tools.jar to the Classpath (this is located in JAVA_HOME/jdk/lib
This should resolve the problem.  


INSTUCTIONS IN THE WORKS

The main purpose of XMLPipeDB is to use it to load xml files into a database.

(1) Place your .XSD file into the "schema" folder removing any other .XSD 
files in the same folder.

(2) Install and setup a database, with a username & password.

(2) Run the build file using ant.  The default is a full build of the project.

(3) Start up the application by running the "Viewer".

(4) Configure your settings under the "database" tab.

(5) Choose a file from the "Import" tab.
