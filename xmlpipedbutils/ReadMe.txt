This is the readme for XmlPipeDb Utilities.

The goal of XPDU is to provide a set of classes for configuring, loading 
and accessing XmlPipeDb databases. XPDU also provides a sample application
that uses these classes on the canonical books.xsd and books.xml examples.

In order to compile these classes, you should have the following jar files
in your build path (one or two may not be needed, but I couldn't bother to
figure this out - so just included them  all).
hibernate3.jar
hyperjaxb2.jar
jaxb-api.jar
jaxb-impl.jar
jaxb-libs.jar
jaxb-xjc.jar
namespace.jar
relaxngDatatype.jar
xsdlib.jar

All of these should be available in the hyperjaxb2 download, which you can
find at: https://hyperjaxb2.dev.java.net/
